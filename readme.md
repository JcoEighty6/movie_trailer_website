#My Favorite Movies - Website

**This is a simple python project to build a webpage using the Udacity Fresh_Tomatoes python script**

This project incorporates a custom wrapper class for easy access to The Movie Database (TMDB)
and requires an API key in order for the classes to populate data to the website.

To obtain an API key go to the [SignUp Page](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) 
and register for and account. Once registered navigate to API and request a key.

Once you have a key isntall the python tmdb module using pip or easy install:
'''
	pip install tmdbsimple
'''

After you have installed that just place your API key into the tmdb_api.py file
in the '__init__' function and you are all set to build your own movies webpage!

TMDB offers documentation for its API over at the [APIARY](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/)

ENJOY!
